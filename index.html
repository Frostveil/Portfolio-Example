    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <ul>
      <p><li>In my spare time, I mostly play games, video edit, watch all kinds of videos, and do some personal projects like drawing and story writing. After graduating high school, however, I had way more time for myself.</li></p>

      <p><li>So, I wanted to do something productive with that extra free-time by going into coding. I've always wanted to learn how to do code so why not now? With the help of <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, I have begun my journey into the coding world and hope to master the skill.</li></p>

      <p><li>If you are interested in a new developer such as myself, feel free to reach out to me in the contacts below! I'll make sure to give all the effort I can for whatever you need me to do! Especially in a team where I'll do my best to uphold my part in the team!</li></p>
