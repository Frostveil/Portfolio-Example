    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>On my spare time, I mostly play games, video edit, watch all kinds of videos, and do some personal projects like drawing and story writing. After graduating high school, however, I had way more time for myself.</p>

    <p>So, I wanted to do something productive with that extra free-time by going into coding. I've always wanted to learn how to do code so why not now? With the help of <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I have begun my journey into the coding world and hope to master the skill.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in a new developer such as myself, feel free to reach out to me in the contacts below! I'll make sure to give all the effort I can for whatever you need me to do!</p>
